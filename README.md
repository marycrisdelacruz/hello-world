# hello-world

Hello everyone! 

   I'm Mary Cris N. Dela Cruz from Masbate Province. 
I am currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at University of Cebu Main. 
Since I was a kid I want to be a programmer and I thought it was just easy. 
When I was in my First year of College I realized that programming is hard. 
There are many things to learn and I found out that I should not depend on my Instructor.
